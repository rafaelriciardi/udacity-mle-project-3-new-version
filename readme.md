This project has been developed for the Udacity's Machine Learning Engeneer nano degree program.

The ideia was to create and deploy a live Machine Learning API with integrated CI/CD process for a model that can predicts if a certain person (based on some census data) would have a salary lower or greater than 50k.

The project has been deployed using Render, once Heroku has nno free tier anymore.
